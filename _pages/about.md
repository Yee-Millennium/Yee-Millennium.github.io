I am a rising senior undergraduate student majoring in Honors Mathematics & Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interest lies in large-scale optimization algorithms and their applications in machine learning. I am interested in applying for PhD position in Computer Science / Operations Research / Applied Mathematics starting in 2025 Fall. 

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com) at UW-Madison. I also have the privilege to be advised by [Prof. Hanbaek Lyu](https://hanbaeklyu.com) during a [Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU)](https://hanbaeklyu.com/reu/) program.
